Okay, so here's some ideas for formatting. Don't know if we can add the amount of days ago since the post was made? It's not really necessary though. Anyway, these are just some formatting ideas to give visual interest and some separation between elements.

So basically all I did was: 
Added an intro sentence for the email
Titles are orange, 20pt font
Subtitles (i.e. post name/link) is green, 14 pt font
Posted By: Name becomes bolded, name still italicized, and that entire line is dark gray, 11 pt font
Body of the post is dark gray, 12 pt font, and indented once
Links within a post are left the default blue
The posts from the last three weeks is almost the same as it was. Just added a title, made to fit the colors and the "posted by" text made 11 pt instead of 12
